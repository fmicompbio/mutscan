\usage{
plotFiltering(
  se,
  valueType = "reads",
  onlyActiveFilters = FALSE,
  displayNumbers = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{se}{A \code{SummarizedExperiment} object, e.g. from 
\code{summarizeExperiment}.}

\item{valueType}{Either "reads" or "fractions", indicating whether to 
plot the number of reads, or the fraction of the total number of reads,
that are retained after each filtering step.}

\item{onlyActiveFilters}{Logical scalar, whether to only include the 
active filters (i.e., where any read was filtered out in any of the samples). 
Defaults to \code{FALSE}, i.e., including all filters.}

\item{displayNumbers}{Logical scalar, indicating whether to display the 
number (or fraction) of reads retained at every filtering step.}
}
\description{
Display the number (or fraction) of reads remaining after each step 
of the internal \code{mutscan} filtering.
}
\details{
The function assumes that the number of reads filtered out in each step 
are provided as columns of \code{colData(se)}, with column names 
of the form \code{f[0-9]_filteringreason}, and that all filtering columns 
occur between the columns named \code{nbrTotal} and \code{nbrRetained}.
