Description: Provides functionality for processing and statistical analysis 
    of multiplexed assays of variant effect (MAVE) and similar data. The 
    package contains functions covering the full workflow from raw FASTQ 
    files to publication-ready visualizations. A broad range of library 
    designs can be processed with a single, unified interface.
